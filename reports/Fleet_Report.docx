1. Introduction & Problem Statement

MetroMove Transit Services operates a mixed fleet of vehicles that serve thousands of trips daily. The organization faces ongoing challenges related to delayed deliveries, unsafe driving behavior, and unpredictable vehicle maintenance expenses. These challenges lead to operational inefficiencies, increased costs, and reduced service quality.

This project aims to design and implement an intelligent Fleet Analytics and Decision Support System using machine learning and deep learning. The system analyzes historical fleet data to:

Identify high-risk operational trips.

Predict maintenance expenses.

Support proactive planning and resource allocation.

Compare classical machine learning with deep learning models.

The goal is to assist MetroMove in improving operational reliability, optimizing fleet usage, and reducing maintenance-related risk.

2. Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle:

Fleet Dataset: fleet_dummy_5000.csv
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nhmishuk/fleet-dataset

Number of Records: 5,000
Number of Features: 25

Key Attributes

Trip Information: trip_id, origin, destination, pickup_time

Vehicle Information: vehicle_id, vehicle_type

Cost Metrics: fuel_cost, driver_pay, maintenance_cost, toll_cost

Location Data: gps_start_lat, gps_start_lon, gps_end_lat, gps_end_lon

Driving Behavior: speeding_incidents, violation_count

Environmental Conditions: weather_condition

Trip Status: status

Data Characteristics

No missing data.

Mix of numerical and categorical attributes.

Well-suited for both classification and regression tasks.

3. Machine Learning Tasks
3.1 Classification Task – Trip Risk Detection

The goal of classification is to predict whether a trip is operationally high-risk or not.

The status column was transformed into a binary label:

High Risk (1): "Delayed"

Normal (0): "Delivered", "Scheduled", "In Transit"

This allows the system to identify trips that require special attention or intervention.

Class Distribution:

Normal Trips: 4499

Delayed Trips: 501

3.2 Regression Task – Maintenance Cost Prediction

The regression objective is to predict the maintenance cost of fleet vehicles based on driving behavior, distance, and operating conditions.

Target variable:

maintenance_cost

Features used:

Distance traveled

Fuel and toll costs

Load value

Speeding and violations

GPS-based features

Time-of-day and day-of-week indicators

4. Data Preprocessing
4.1 Feature Engineering

The following derived attributes were created:

pickup_hour

pickup_dayofweek

delivery_delay_min (difference between actual and planned delivery time)

4.2 Data Leakage Prevention

Initial regression results were unrealistically perfect due to accidental inclusion of derived attributes such as profit_margin, which is mathematically dependent on maintenance_cost. These features were removed.

This prevented leakage and produced valid model evaluations.

4.3 Data Splitting

The dataset was split into:

Training set: 80%

Testing set: 20%

Stratified splitting was used for classification to preserve the class distribution.

4.4 Scaling

StandardScaler was used to normalize numeric features before applying Logistic Regression and Deep Learning models.

5. Classification Models & Results

Two baseline classification models were developed:

5.1 Logistic Regression (Baseline)

This model achieved high accuracy but failed to detect delayed trips due to class imbalance.

5.2 Random Forest Classifier

Random Forest also exhibited strong bias toward the majority class and did not detect delayed trips.

5.3 Balanced Logistic Regression (Final Model)

To address class imbalance, class weighting was introduced.

Metric	Value (Delayed Trips)
Recall	46%
Precision	9%
Accuracy	50%

This represents a significant improvement in detecting delayed trips, although it increased false alarms.

Interpretation:
The balanced model prioritizes detecting risks at the cost of lower overall accuracy, making it suitable for safety-critical applications.

6. Regression Models & Results
6.1 Linear Regression

After removing leakage, Linear Regression performed poorly:

R² ≈ 0.00

MAE ≈ 63

6.2 Random Forest Regression

The Random Forest regressor slightly underperformed Linear Regression:

R² < 0

MAE ≈ 64

Interpretation:
The dataset did not contain strong predictive indicators for maintenance cost. Regression revealed that data quality and feature relevance are more important than model complexity.

7. Hyperparameter Tuning
7.1 Logistic Regression Tuning

GridSearchCV was applied to optimize:

Regularization strength (C)

Solver type

Best configuration:

C = 0.01

solver = 'liblinear'

Recall ≈ 47%

7.2 Random Forest Regression Tuning

Tuned hyperparameters:

n_estimators = 50

max_depth = 10

Minimal improvement was achieved.

8. Deep Learning Model

A feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers (32 and 16 neurons) was trained.

Despite using a more complex architecture, the neural network:

Failed to predict delayed trips

Achieved 90% accuracy by predicting only normal trips

Conclusion:
Deep learning did not outperform classical machine learning. Balanced Logistic Regression was the superior approach for this dataset.

9. Conclusions & Business Impact

This project demonstrates how machine learning can:

Highlight risky operations

Detect limitations in raw data

Expose data leakage issues

Aid decision-making based on classification reliability rather than accuracy alone

Balanced Logistic Regression emerged as the most practical model for fleet risk detection.

10. Future Improvements

Future system enhancements may include:

Integration of engine telemetry and GPS trajectory data

Better cost-related predictors

Real-time streaming data ingestion

Larger and real-world fleet datasets

Automated reporting dashboards
