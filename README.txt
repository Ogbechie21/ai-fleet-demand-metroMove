AI-Based Fleet Performance and Passenger Demand Prediction System

This project is for MetroMove Transit Services. It will use machine learning
and deep learning to:
- Classify trips (e.g., delayed vs on-time)
- Predict continuous values (e.g., passenger demand)
- Eventually deploy a web-based decision support system in the cloud.
